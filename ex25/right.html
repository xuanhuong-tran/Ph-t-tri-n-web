          This month Middle Age Arts introduces the Gargoyle Collection.
          I'm really excited about this new set of classical figures.

        </p>
        <p>
          The collection contains faithful reproductions of gargoyles from some
          of the famous cathedrals of Europe, including Notre Dame, Rheims and
          Warwick Castle. All reproductions are done to exacting and loving detail.
        </p>
        <p>
          The collection also contains original works by noted artists such as
          Susan Bedford and Antonio Salvani. Our expert artisans have produced
          some wonderful and whimsical works, perfectly suited for home or garden use.
        </p>

          Don’t delay, order your gargoyle today!

        <p>
          Don’t think you need a gargoyle? Think again. Gargoyles are useful as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Bird baths</li>
          <li>Bookends</li>
          <li>Paperweights</li>
          <li>Pen holders</li>
          <li>Wind chimes</li>
        </ul>
