  <h3><strong>People</strong></h3>
  <p>
    The Vietnamese population exceeds 78.7 million divided in 54 ethnic groups. The largest group is the Viet, 
    or Kinh, accounting for 80% of the whole population concentrating in the plain areas while minorities occupy 
    the highlands and the mountains.

  <p>
    There is no official religion in Vietnam, but Buddhism is relatively popular. Some of the Catholic churches 
    and Buddhist pagodas are interesting tourist attractions. There are religions more specific to the southern 
    regions of the country such as the CaoDai sect, the Hoa Hao sect, and Islam. Most Vietnamese worship their ancestors.
