            <h3>A letter from one of our guests</h3>
            <p>
              I'm writing to tell you how much I enjoyed my retreat at Dunston. 
              I came to your center haggard and worn out from a long illness and job difficulties. 
              I left totally refreshed. I especially want to thank Father Thomas Holloway for his support.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've enthusiastically told all of my friends about the wonderful place you have. 
              Some of us are hoping to organize a group retreat. Rest assured that I will see you again. 
              Going to Dunston will become a yearly event for me.
            </p>
